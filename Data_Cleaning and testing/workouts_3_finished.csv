Frontal elevations,Upper Body,Push,Shoulders,Barbell,"To execute the exercise, the lifter stands with the feet separated to the width of the shoulders and weights or resistance mangoes are sustained to the sides with a grip in pronation (above the head).

The movement consists of carrying the arms in front of the body at the height of the eyes and with only a slight flexion of the elbow.This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (in front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.

When lifting it is important to keep the body motionless so that the anterior deltoid is completely used;If the weight cannot be lifted while still, then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed.It is important to maintain a slight flexion in the elbow when lifting, since keeping the elbow will add tension to the elbow joint and could cause injuries.

You can also use a neutral grip, similar to the one used in the hammer curl.With this variation, the weight rises again to the eye level, but at an angle of 45 degrees from the front of the body.This can be beneficial for people with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the sleeve of the rotators."

Front Pull narrow,Upper Body,Pull,Back,Barbell,Unavailable
Front Raises,Upper Body,Push,Shoulders,Barbell,"To execute the exercise, the lifter stands with their feet shoulder width apart and weights or resistance handles held by their side with a pronated (overhand) grip.
The movement is to bring the arms up in front of the body to eye level and with only a slight bend in the elbow. This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.
When lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.
A neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff."

Muscle up,Upper Body,Pull,Back,Pull-up bar,"The body is then explosively pulled up by the arms in a radial pull-up, with greater speed than a regular pull-up. When the bar approaches the upper chest, the wrists are swiftly flexed to bring the forearms above the bar. The body is leaned forward, and the elbows are straightened by activating the triceps. The routine is considered complete when the bar is at the level of the waist and the arms are fully straight.
To dismount, the arms are bent at the elbow, and the body is lowered to the floor, and the exercise can be repeated.
As a relatively advanced exercise, muscle-ups are typically first learned with an assistive kip. The legs swing (kip) up and provide momentum to assist in the explosive upward force needed to ascend above the bar. More advanced athletes can perform a strict variation of the muscle-up which is done slowly, without any kip. This variation begins with a still dead hang and uses isometric muscle contraction to ascend above the bar in a slow, controlled fashion."

Pull UPS on the machine,Upper Body,Pull,Back,Unavailable,"Machine pull-ups are an assisted variation of traditional pull-up exercise.They are designed to help people who are developing the strength to perform the full movement.The machine allows you to adjust the weight to provide adequate support during exercise.

To perform pushups on the machine, follow the following steps: position yourself correctly, adjust the weight to the desired support, hold the bar with your hands aligned with your shoulders, keep your arms straight and erect posture.Start the movement by flexing the elbows and pulling the body toward the bar.Go up until your chin is above the bar and your shoulders are firm.

The descent should be done controlled, fully extending the arms.Realize the desired number of repetitions, adapting it to your skill.Remember to breathe properly during exercise, inspiring the descending phase and expiring when pulling your body up.

Regular machine push -up practice will strengthen the muscles of the back, shoulders and arms, helping to improve posture and overall force.As you gain more strength, you can gradually reduce the assistance provided by the machine and progress to traditional flexion without help.

This variation of exercise is an accessible option for beginners or people who fight to perform complete flexions.Remember to adapt the weight and number of repetitions according to your level of strength and capacity.Regular practice and gradual progression will help improve their shape and progress toward complete flexions."

Push-Ups,Upper Body,Push,Chest,Bodyweight,"Push-ups are an exercise in which a person, keeping a prone position, with the hands palms down under the shoulders, the balls of the feet on the ground, and the back straight, pushes the body up and lets it down by an alternate straightening and bending of the arms."
Push-Ups | Decline,Upper Body,Push,Chest,Incline bench,"Decline push-ups are another modified version of the traditional push-up that target the upper body muscles in a different way. To perform a decline push-up, elevate your feet on an elevated surface, such as a bench, chair, or step, while placing your hands on the ground in a push-up position. Lower your body towards the ground while maintaining a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles, and then push back up to the starting position.

Unlike the inclined push-up, the decline push-up places more emphasis on the shoulders and triceps, while still engaging the chest muscles to a lesser extent. By elevating your feet, you increase the difficulty of the exercise by placing more weight on your upper body, forcing your shoulders and triceps to work harder to push your body back up. The decline push-up can be a great way to challenge your upper body strength and improve your ability to perform other push-up variations. As with any exercise, be sure to use proper form and start with a height that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."
Push-Ups | Incline,Upper Body,Push,Chest,Incline bench,"Inclined push-ups primarily target the chest muscles (pectoralis major and minor), but also work the triceps, shoulders, and core to a lesser extent. Because the upper body is elevated, the incline push-up places less emphasis on the triceps compared to regular push-ups, which may be beneficial for individuals looking to specifically target their chest muscles."
Push-Ups | Parallettes,Upper Body,Push,Chest,Unavailable,"Parallettes push-ups are a variation of the traditional push-up that are performed with the hands on parallel bars, known as parallettes. To perform a parallettes push-up, assume a push-up position with your hands on the parallettes and your feet on the ground. Lower your body towards the ground while keeping your elbows close to your sides, and then push back up to the starting position.

Parallettes push-ups place more emphasis on the chest and shoulders compared to traditional push-ups, as they allow for a greater range of motion in the shoulder joint. This increased range of motion can also help to improve shoulder stability and mobility. Additionally, parallettes push-ups engage the core muscles more than traditional push-ups, as the instability of the parallettes requires greater activation of the core muscles to maintain proper form.

The added challenge of balancing on the parallettes also requires greater upper body strength and control, making parallettes push-ups a more advanced variation of the traditional push-up. They can be a great way to challenge yourself and add variety to your upper body workout routine. As always, be sure to use proper form and start with a level that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."
