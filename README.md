# Workout Recommender System

## Overview
The Workout Recommender System is an interactive tool designed to generate personalized workout routines based on user preferences. Users can specify force, equipment type, targeted body parts, and their goals. The system then provides workouts for the specifications, complete with exercise descriptions, sets, reps, rest, and weight type.
