# Workout Recommender System

## Overview
The Workout Recommender System is an interactive tool designed to generate personalized workout routines based on user preferences. Users can specify workout duration, equipment type, targeted body parts, and the desired length of their workout plan. The system then provides a tailored workout routine, complete with exercise descriptions, sets, reps, and video links.
