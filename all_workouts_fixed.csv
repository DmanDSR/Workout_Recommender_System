Hang from bar,Core,Hold,Abs,Bodyweight,"The hang from bar is a static exercise that involves hanging from a bar by two hands. It can either be an ""active hang,"" where you pack the shoulders and activate the muscles of the upper back, or a ""passive hang,"" where you let the shoulders unpack and let the muscles of the upper body stretch. A passive hang may not be appropriate for all people depending on their shoulder health, but many coaches believe hanging can be healthy for the shoulders when done properly."

Cross-body plank march,Core,Hold,Abs,Bodyweight,"The cross-body plank march is an exercise targeting the entire core but especially the obliques. It’s more difficult than a standard plank, with the extra stabilization challenge of bringing one knee at a time off the ground toward the opposing elbow. This will increase the challenge to the core and shoulder muscles, but also present a coordination and balance challenge."
Bent-knee Copenhagen hip adduction,Core,Hold,Abs,Bodyweight,"The bent-knee Copenhagen hip adduction is an advanced exercise that combines the isometric stabilization of the Copenhagen plank with dynamic adductions to challenge the core stabilizers and adductors. This exercise targets the same muscles as the side plank, including the obliques, shoulders, and lateral hips, but places extra emphasis on the adductors and is more difficult than side planks on the floor. Most lifters will need to progress to this version after mastering the basic side plank or Copenhagen plank first."

It starts in a plank-style position, with the arms resting on a ball. Then, roll the ball out in front of you as far as you can while maintaining a strong, neutral spinal position. The lack of stability from the ball increases the degree of difficulty. This is a difficult movement, and beginners may need to use a limited range of motion."
Medicine ball pass,Core,Hold,Abs,Medicine Ball,"The medicine ball pass is a simple partner-based exercise that involves throwing a weighted ball back and forth. It can be part of a dynamic warm-up for lifting or athletics, but can also work as active rest or as a component of circuit training."

Exercise ball crunch,Core,Hold,Abs,Exercise Ball,"The exercise ball crunch is a popular gym exercise targeting the abdominals. Unlike crunches on the floor or a bench, by using a ball you can increase the range of motion and both stretch and contract the abs on every rep. The ball crunch can be performed for low reps with a slower tempo focusing on a hard contraction, or for higher reps."
Feet-elevated crunch,Core,Hold,Abs,Exercise Ball,"The feet-elevated crunch is a variation on the basic crunch, a very popular ab move. Resting the feet on a bench takes some of the hip flexor activation out of the movement, focusing the stress more on the abs.

It involves thrusting the hips into full flexion over a ball, then extending out to a foot-elevated plank with the feet on the ball. It's a challenging move from a strength perspective, but also for balance. It can be the centerpiece of an ab workout or go along with other body weight or ball movements in an ab circuit."
Exercise ball bird dog,Core,Hold,Abs,Exercise Ball,"The exercise ball bird dog is a dynamic movement focusing on the glutes and the postural muscles of the upper back. When performing it, use an exercise ball that is tall enough to support your chest and core, but short enough to allow your hands and knees to reach the ground. It is slightly easier than a bodyweight bird dog and can work as a regression for that movement. It can be done for time or reps as part of a warm-up, paired with movements in a workout, or as a mobility or recovery exercise."
Exercise ball superman,Core,Hold,Abs,Exercise Ball,"The exercise ball superman is a slightly more advanced variation of the bodyweight superman exercise.

30 Side Plank On Ball,Core,Hold,Abs,Exercise Ball,"The feet-elevated side plank on ball is a more advanced version of a traditional bodyweight side plank. The feet are balanced on an exercise ball, providing a balance challenge but also increasing the load placed upon the obliques and shoulder muscles.

This makes it more difficult than straight-arm planks on the floor, but also puts more emphasis on the shoulder muscles.

Barbell Curl,Upper Body,Pull,Arms,Barbell,"Detailed How To: Grab the barbell with a shoulder width, underhand grip. Flex at the elbows until your forearms press into your bicep (this will look different from person to person). Begin to extend your elbows and control the weight during the eccentric part of the exercise. Make sure to fully extend your elbows at the end of the rep. Repeat until you hit muscular fatigue (13 reps left in the tank)Ty's TipsOne of the drawbacks with a Barbell Curl is the bar limits Range of Motion somewhat. The bar will hit your legs before you can fully extend your arms. On most exercises, we want the longest Range or Motion possible. To remedy this,Push your butt back a tad bit. This will give you a little more room to fully extend your elbows.Watch out for cheating. Using momentum often naturally happens with a Barbell Curl (and most Dumbbell curl variations). There is a move called the Cheat Curl popularized by Arnold himself. But consider that a separate exercise.Root your feet to the floor and use a mirror to watch your form. If your hips begin moving and you're unable to continue to perform reps without any hip movement, end the set.A 612 rep range works well for this exercise."

Chin Ups,Upper Body,Pull,Back,Bodyweight,"How To Perform The Chin UpSetupGrab the Chin Up bar with an underhand grip. Make sure the bars are set very deeply in your hand. Your palms should be making contact with the bar. Next, if you are using a bench or box to reach the Chin Up bars, step off of the step, and hold for a second, in a dead hang position. If you begin initiating the reps before the dead hang, you might swing too much to perform the exercise strictly. If you can reach the bars without having to stand on anything, take your grip and then pull your feet slightly off the floor. Still hold for a second to prevent any swinging from happening.Pull your shoulder blades down. This will engage your mid and lower traps and force your lats to do most of the work. Also, before beginning the first rep, make sure your elbows are extended.Lower bodyAngle your legs forward slightly, push your hips back, and point your toes. This will force you to flex your abdominals and keep you more stable throughout the rep. (This will massively help you keep the reps strict).PerformingOnce you are in the proper position, begin to pull. Imagine trying to pull your elbows straight down to your sides.Get your chin over the bar before beginning the eccentric portion of the rap. Your elbows should fully extend at the bottom of each rep.Progressing The Chin UpDecide on a rep range. For example, 6 to 10. Once you are able to perform 10 reps with strict form, then it is time to progress. Do not be shy or hesitant to start adding weight early on. Even if it is only 5 pounds. Progress is progress! From there, progress like you would any other exercise. Once you hit the top end of the rep range, add some more weight.The best way to get better at doing Chin Ups is to do Chin Ups. But if you can't do them in the first place, then what should you do? Try the Neutral Grip Chin Up. It’s an easier variation because the lats are in their strongest position.Shorten the range of motion, and try to get a longer range of motion overtime. if you can only do half a Chin Up, (meaning you can get your elbows to roughly 90°) don't be ashamed to do those half reps. Set a rep range like with anything else. We will use 5 to 8 reps for this example. Once you are able to hit 8 of the half reps, try to go an extra 2 to 3 inches higher on each rep. You won't be able to do 8 when you advance the range of motion. So Build your way back up to 8. It helps massively if you can do this in front of a mirror to keep a very close eye on your range of motion. Before long you'll be able to perform full reps."

Barbell Bench Press,Upper Body,Push,Chest,Barbell,"Detailed HowToDo Your Work Early (The Setup)We're going to start from the feet and work our way up.Foot PlacementYou can either be flat footed or just have toes on the ground. Either way, push your toes to generate some tension in your quads. Generating tension through your whole body will help you lift more weight. Torso TechniquePoint your rib cage at the ceiling and pull your shoulder blades back really hard. Dig your shoulder blades into the bench. This will arch your spine somewhat. This is the only time it is ok to extend your spine. Because you are braced against the bench, the bench will soak up a lot of the tension that would otherwise fall on your lumbar spine.GripGrip width should be just outside of shoulder width. Make sure the bar is set very deeply in your hands. This will help prevent your wrists from getting extended, which will in run help you handle more weight safely. Performing The Bench PressUnrack the bar. Break at the elbows and bring the bar toward your rib cage, not chest. The bar path should be an arc like curve.Make sure the bar touches your rib cage before you initiate the concentric. At the top of the rep, extend your elbows but stop short of hyperextending as this could lead to an injury. When the rep is complete, slam the bar back into the rack, then lower into the hooks/cups.Ty's TipsTiming is everythingAs you perform the eccentric, you want to move under control, but not slowly. I've seen many times a client or friend miss a heavy rep on the bench press because they moved too slowly during the lowering phase. Moving slowly during the eccentric is usually caused by unsureness. Think about it, when you're lifting a heavy weight, and not sure if you are going to complete it, you move slower.Also, try to properly time out when you initiate the press. You should begin pressing back toward the ceiling as the bar is touching your sternum.Lift with confidence always! If you fail the rep, then you failed the rep. No big deal. Just keep it pushing and you'll get it at some point. This leads me to my second tip.No Shame in Asking For HelpDon't be hesitant to ask for a spot if you don't have a gym partner. Most people are happy to help. There's research showing that a lifter will perform better with a spotter. Your muscles won't be any stronger with or without a spotter of course. So why the improvement in performance? The confidence alluded to in the how to section. Knowing someone is there to get the bar if you fail provides the security to allow you to lift with confidence.Just make sure you communicate before starting the set. First, ask them to give you a lift off. I've had many ask me for a spot then say they don't want a lift off. Never quite understood why. In many cases (unless you have very long arms), you will lose your shoulder blade retraction when trying to unrack the bar. If your arms are mostly extended the only choice you have to unrack is to protract your shoulder blades. The further you can get your shoulder blades pulled back the better. Retracting the shoulder blades also gives more room in the shoulder joint so it is generally a safer position.Also, let the spotter know how many reps you're going for so they know what to expect and don't jump in too early. Let them know whether or not you want help completing any reps. For example, ""I'm going for 10 reps, but i might fail around 8. If I can't get the all the reps by myself can you help me get the remaining ones?"" Although, I suggest once you hit muscular fatigue, you end your set. Once a muscle hits fatigue, doing additional reps does not induce more muscle growth, but does fatigue you more. Too much risk, not enough reward."
Dips,Upper Body,Push,Chest,Bodyweight,"Hold your body with arms locked above the equipment, Lower your body slowly while leaning forward, flare out your elbows, Raise your body above the bars until your arms are locked."
Dumbbell Incline Bench Press,Upper Body,Push,Chest,Dumbbell,"How To Perform The Dumbbell Incline Bench PressSetupSet an incline bench at around 30° high. Any higher than 30°, and the tension will go to your anterior deltoid as opposed to your upper pecs. A low incline is all you need. Getting the dumbbells into position for an incline bench press can be challenging. You've got a couple of options here.Start with the dumbbells sitting vertically on your quads. Push one leg up toward the ceiling and get your elbow underneath the dumbbell. Then repeat on the other leg with the other dumbbell as you fall back onto the bench. Have a gym partner help out. If you're going to have someone help. Make sure they either grab your wrists or the dumbbells themselves to help you get into position. Some people have a tendency to push the elbows up in order to get the dumbbells in position for this move. This can be dangerous as the dumbbell might fall laterally one direction, or another.Make sure both feet are planted firmly on the ground. Push your toes through the front of your shoes. This will generate some tension through your quads and keep you more stable. Like any other bench press, pull your shoulder blades back and dig them into the bench. Also point your ribs up toward the ceiling, giving yourself a minor arch in your spine. Performing Press the weights up toward the ceiling to initiate your first rep. Extend your elbows, but do not fully lock them out. As you perform the eccentric, maintain a 45° angle between your upper arm and torso. Your elbows should not be flared all the way out, or tucked all the way in, but in the middle between the two. Stop the eccentric when your elbows are even with your torso or slightly behind your torso. The pecs are not designed well to function when your upper arm travels behind your body. Because the pecs are two lengthened in this position, they will not be able to generate force properly. All the tension from the dumbbells will go onto your shoulder joint instead of your muscles. Getting from underneath the dumbbells at the end of the set can be challenging as well. You also have two options here. If you end the set by completing your last rep, meaning your elbows are extended and the dumbbells are away from your body, turn your fists into a neutral position, lift your legs up touching the dumbbell to your quads, and then roll your entire body forward. This can take some practice, so try it with light dumbbells first.If you end the set not having completed your final rep, meaning the dumbbells are against your chest, then you have no choice but to dump the dumbbells off of you onto the ground. Be very careful with this. Do your best to control the weights as you get them off of you, so they do not bounce. If the dumbbells bounce off the floor and land on someone's foot, you have an issue on your hands. Some gyms don't want any dropping of weights at all. Try to set them down as gently as possible, but don't injure yourself in the process. "

Barbell Close Grip Bench Press,Upper Body,Push,Arms,Barbell,"How To Perform The Close Grip Bench PressSetting UpFoot PlacementYou can either be flat footed or just have toes on the ground. Either way, push your toes to generate some tension in your quads. Generating tension through your whole body will help you lift more weight. Torso TechniquePoint your rib cage at the ceiling and pull your shoulder blades back really hard. Dig your shoulder blades into the bench. This will arch your spine somewhat. This is the only time it is ok to extend your spine. Because you are braced against the bench, the bench will soak up a lot of the tension that would otherwise fall on your lumbar spine.GripGrip width should be exactly shoulder width.  Bringing your hands closer than shoulder width will not increase the range of motion at your elbows (the joint the triceps act on). And going any closer than shoulder width tends to only put more stress on your wrist and shoulder joints. If you are not sure what a shoulder width grip is, simply point both of your arms straight out in front of you. You can also lay on the bench and do this. Use the markings on the bar to make sure your hands are even as well. Make sure the bar is set very deeply in your hands. This will help keep your wrists in a strong neutral position. Also, this will prevent your wrists from getting extended. Performing The close Grip Bench PressAfter you have unracked the bar, you will initiate the rep by breaking at the elbows. Took your elbows very hard into your side. The bar should land lower on your torso than it does with a normal bench press. As you tap your torso with the bar begin to press the bar back up toward the ceiling in a J shaped arc. Make sure to extend (but not hyperextend) your elbows at the top of each rep."

In our demo video, we are using a rope so our instructions will be specific to that.Grab onto the rope and take a few steps back. You can start with your elbows in an extended or flexed position.Push your butt back slightly. This will get your hips out of the way giving your arms enough room to fully extend.Performing The Cable PushdownMy favorite cue to use on the Tricep Push Down is, ""TRex arms."" It's extremely important that you keep your upper arm and your elbows glued to your side. Your elbow joint should be causing the movement and your forearm should be the only moving body part. This will keep the stress and tension purely on your triceps and not recruit other body parts. Make sure to fully extend and flex your elbows on each rep.Be careful of swinging and bouncing on this exercise. It is very common to use too much weight on this exercise. If you find yourself having to use momentum, the weight is too heavy. Also, if you notice your shoulders beginning to roll forward on the concentric, the weight is too heavy. Your central nervous system is extremely intelligent and will help you get from point A to point B by any means necessary. It will begin trying to recruit your anterior deltoid and pec major by rolling your shoulders forward on top of the rope or straight bar so you can press the weight down instead of performing a strict Triceps Extension."

Also, make sure the dumbbell is set very deeply in your hand so your wrist stays in a strong position for the entire set.Performing Press the dumbbells up toward the ceiling, fully extending your elbows.

Barbell Front Raise,Upper Body,Push,Shoulders,Barbell,"Barbell Front Raise: A Comprehensive GuideSetupBegin by selecting a weight that is suitable for your level of strength and experiencePlace the barbell on the ground in front of you, with the weight plates on either side of the barGrasp the barbell with a pronated grip, meaning your palms are facing down, and your hands are spaced roughly shoulderwidth apartPosition yourself so that the barbell is resting on your thighs, and your knees are slightly bentHow to PerformLift the barbell up towards your chest, using your arms, and keeping your torso stationaryPause briefly at the top of the movement, and then lower the barbell back down to the starting position in a controlled mannerRepeat the exercise for the desired number of repetitions, typically between 812 reps for each setTechniqueMake sure to keep your elbows slightly bent throughout the exercise, and avoid locking them out at the top of the movementKeep your chest lifted and your shoulder blades pulled back, engaging your shoulder and upper back musclesExhale as you lift the barbell up, and inhale as you lower it back downKeep your movements slow and controlled, focusing on proper form and technique, rather than lifting as much weight as possibleThings to AvoidAvoid using momentum or swinging the weight, as this can lead to injury and decreased effectiveness of the exerciseAvoid overextending your shoulders or lifting the barbell too high, which can cause strain on the shoulder jointAvoid lifting the barbell too quickly or using too heavy of a weight, as this can result in poor form and decreased resultsAvoid holding the barbell with a narrow grip, as this can put unnecessary stress on your wrist joints"
Barbell Overhead Press,Upper Body,Push,Shoulders,Barbell,"How To Perform The Barbell Overhead PressSetupPlace the hooks or cups in the barbell rack just below shoulder height. This way you don't have to go up onto your tippy toes to get the bar out of the rack. Take a shoulder width or slightly outside of shoulder width grip. You can use a thumbed or thumbless grip. Be very careful with a thumbless grip please. Either way, make sure the bar is set very deeply into your hands. If the bar is not deep in your palm, you will likely get extended wrists. Wrist extension will put a lot of pressure onto your wrists and will cause either discomfort or outright pain. And of course this will limit the amount of weight you can use.Once you have your grip, push your elbows underneath the bar. The bar should be roughly at your collar bones. Break at the knees and do a mini squat to get the bar up and out of the rack. Take two steps back. Your stance should be about shoulder or slightly outside shoulder width.PerformingPull your chin back as you initiate the concentric. Press the bar toward the ceiling. Once the bar has cleared your head, push your head forward slightly. I like to use the cue, ""head through the window."" Don't force your head all the way forward as it's unnecessary and might produce unneeded stress on your neck.You should fully extend your elbows at the top of each rep. If you have hypermobile elbows (many women do) don't hyperextend your elbows at the top. There should be a straight line from your shoulder joint to your fist.Once you have hit elbow extension, time to begin the concentric. Make sure to control the weight on your way down. As the bar is getting to about head height, pull your chin back again to let the bar pass by your face. Pay particular attention to cheating on this exercise. This is a strict overhead barbell press. It is very easy when you fatigue to begin using your legs to help you get the bar up.  Make sure you keep your lower body from helping at all.Also pay particular attention to your lumbar spine. It is very common for people to lean back and hyper extend their lower back in order to get the bar all the way overhead. Your nervous system is very smart, and knows that you are stronger pushing horizontally than you are vertically. It will therefore, naturally try to turn the overhead press into a horizontal press. This is a very dangerous position for your lower back. Don't let it happen!"

Machine Pulldown,Upper Body,Pull,Back,Machine,"How To Perform The PulldownSetupFirst, adjust the thigh pad to a position that works well with your height. You should be able to put your legs under the thigh pad fully, but it should be low enough to keep you glued to the chair.There are several grips you can use on a pull down.  In our demo video, we are doing a wide grip overhand pull down, so these instructions will be for that variation in particular.Take an overhand grip just outside the part of the bar that bends downward. You can either use a thumbed or thumbless grip.Hold on tight to the weight and sit straight down throwing your legs underneath the thigh pad. PerformingBefore you start the rep, make sure your elbows are in a fully extended position. Your ears should be between your biceps. As you initiate the pull, lean back slightly. Imagine you are trying to pull your elbows in toward your rib cage, and not just downward. The bar should land between your collarbone and nipple line. Once you have tapped your chest begin the eccentric. Control the weight on the way back up. The rep will end with your elbows returning to their fully extended position.Be careful about cheating on this exercise. It is very easy (and very common) to use momentum on this exercise. If you are using some body English and jerking the weight to get it from point A to point B and the weight is too heavy. Try going lighter and controlling during both the concentric and eccentric."
Machine Seated Cable Row,Upper Body,Pull,Back,Machine,"Sit with your back straight on the machine and grip the handles., Pull the handles back using your arms.

Pull Ups,Upper Body,Pull,Back,Bodyweight,"How To Perform The Pull UpSetupGrab the Pull Up bar with an overhand grip. If you get wrist pain from gripping a Pull Up bar, try using a thumbless grip. It won't affect your grip strength too much, but will give your wrists a little more room to move. Also, make sure the bars are set very deeply in your hand. Your palms should be making contact with the bar. Next, if you are using a bench or box to reach the Pull Up bars, step off of the step, and hold for a second, in a dead hang position. If you begin initiating the Pull Up before the dead hang, you might swing too much to perform a proper strict Pull Up. If you can reach the Pull Up bars without having to stand on anything, take your grip and then pull your feet slightly off the floor. Still hold for a second to prevent any swinging from happening.Pull your shoulder blades down. This will engage your mid and lower traps and force your lats to do most of the work. Also, before beginning the first rep, make sure your elbows are extended.Lower bodyAngle your legs forward slightly, push your hips back, and point your toes. This will force you to flex your abdominals and keep you more stable throughout the rep. (This will massively help you keep the reps strict).PerformingOnce you are in the proper position, begin to pull. Imagine trying to pull your elbows not just down, but inward toward your spine. This cue will help you engage one of the lats’ more overlooked functions, vertical adduction. Get your chin over the bar before beginning the eccentric portion of the rap. Your elbows should fully extend at the bottom of each rep.Step by Step ProgressionThe Pull Up can be a difficult exercise to know when to progress. There's also the question of how to progress the Pull Up. Decide on a rep range. For example, 6 to 10. Once you are able to perform 10 reps with strict form, then it is time to progress. Do not be shy or hesitant to start adding weight to your Pull Up early on. Even if it is only 5 pounds. Progress is progress! From there, progress the Pull Up, like it would any other exercise. Once you hit the top end of the rep range, add some more weight.The best way to get better at doing Pull Ups is to do Pull Ups. But if you can't do them in the first place, then what should you do? Try the Chin Up. It’s an easier variation because the biceps are much more involved. I suggest you start with that variation if you don't have much experience doing Pull Ups. Shorten the range of motion, and try to get a longer range of motion overtime. if you can only do half a Pull Up (meaning you can get your elbows to roughly 90°) don't be ashamed to do those half reps. Set a rep range like with anything else. We will use 5 to 8 reps for this example. Once you are able to hit 8/2 Pull Ups, cut the reps down to five and try to go an extra 2 to 3 inches higher on each rep. It helps massively if you can do this in front of a mirror to keep a very close eye on your range of motion. Before long you'll be able to perform full reps."
Dumbbell Row Bilateral,Upper Body,Pull,Back,Dumbbell,"Grab both dumbbells and hinge forward at the hips.

Before beginning your set, let your elbows fully extend.The closer your torso is to parallel with the ground. The longer the range of motion will be during your row. The more vertical your torso is, the shorter the range of motion. It's extremely important to hinge as far forward as you can without rounding your back and maintaining that torso position for the entire set.Performing Pull your elbows straight back toward the ceiling until the bar touches your torso. The bar should land somewhere between your belly button and your rib cage. Use the cue, ""squeeze the tennis ball."" Imagine you have a tennis ball in your armpits and when you perform each rep try to squeeze that tennis ball.On the eccentric, let your elbows fully extend before initiating the next rep. Ego lifting is very easy to do with the barbell row. If you find yourself having to bounce or use momentum to get the weight from point A to point B, the weight is too heavy.

Barbell Stiff Leg Deadlifts,Lower Body,Pull,Legs,Barbell,"How To Perform The Stiff Leg DeadliftSetupThe Stiff Leg Deadlift, unlike other deadlift variations, begins and ends in the standing position. So you need to begin the exercise a little bit differently than you would the other deadlift variations.There are a few ways to set up for the stiff leg deadlift.Set the safety bars or hooks in a squat rack just below knee height. From here, you will squat the bar up and out of the safeties. Take a couple of steps back and then initiate the set.Start from the floor. Perform a standard conventional deadlift to get the weight into the starting position.Once you have chosen one of those two ways, and gotten into the starting standing position we can continue the rest of the set up.  Use a shoulder width stance with your toes facing forward. Either a double overhand or mixed grip is OK. There is some risk with the mixed grip variation. On very rare occasions a lifter will pull their bicep on the arm with the underhand grip. So be careful.You want to avoid doing any shrugging of the barbell. This is a posterior chain movement not a trap movement. PerformingBegin the set by pushing your hips straight back. Your knees should stay mostly extended during the set. You can have a slight bend in the knees, but only slight. As you push your hips back, imagine trying to push your hips upwards towards the ceiling as well. This will help you keep your knees in a more extended position.The Stiff Leg Deadlift is a movement that does something unique. It lengthens the hamstring under a load. During a Stiff Leg Deadlift the tension is at its highest when your hamstring is at its most lengthened position (90° at the hips with extended knees). Therefore, the most important part of this exercise is feeling the stretch in your hamstring on each trip. You can also use this to dictate your range of motion. Some people will be able to go all the way to the floor while maintaining a flat back. While others will only be able to get to a 90° hip angle. A rare person with hypermobile hips may even need to consider a Deficit Stiff Leg Deadlift. In which they stand on a platform, letting them go even lower than the barbell and plates would allow for. Again, look for the stretch on each rep and use that feeling to dictate when you initiate the concentric portion of the movement. When you feel the stretch, time to come back up.It's of the utmost importance you keep a flat back so you do not put any unnecessary stress on your lumbar spine. This does not mean you will not feel this exercise in your lower back. The opposite is true. You can and most likely will feel the Stiff Leg Deadlift working your lumbar spine. This does not mean you are doing anything wrong. The lower back has muscles just like everywhere else in your body. These muscles can also fill with blood giving you a pump in your lower back. Unlike having a pump on your biceps or pecs, a pump in your lower back is very uncomfortable because the spinal erectors swell and begin to press into your lumbar spine. Again, this does not mean you were doing anything wrong. You can even expect some soreness in your lower back after performing this movementThe concentric portion of this movement is relatively simple. Just go to a standing position to complete the rep. Do not force your hips all the way forward as this will hyperextend your lumbar spine. Hyperextension is just as dangerous as hyperflexion. "

Barbell Romanian Deadlift,Lower Body,Push,Legs,Barbell,"How To Perform The Romanian DeadliftSetupThe Romanian Deadlift (RDL), unlike other deadlift variations, begins and ends in the standing position. So you need to begin the exercise a little bit differently than you would other deadlift variations.There are a few ways to set up for the Romanian Deadlift.Set the safety bars or hooks in a squat rack just below knee height. From here, you will squat the bar up and out of the safeties. Take a couple of steps back and then initiate the set.Start from the floor. Perform a standard conventional deadlift to get the weight into the starting position.Once you have chosen one of those two ways, and gotten into the starting standing position we can continue the rest of the set up.  Use a shoulder width stance with your toes facing forward. Either a double overhand or mixed grip is OK. There is some risk with the mixed grip variation. On very rare occasions a lifter will pull their bicep on the arm with the underhand grip. So be careful.You want to avoid doing any shrugging of the barbell. This is a posterior chain movement not a trap movement. Performing The Romanian DeadliftBegin the set by pushing your hips straight back. Your knees should stay mostly extended during the set. You can have a slight bend in the knees, but only slight. As you push your hips back, imagine trying to push your hips upwards towards the ceiling as well. This will help you keep your knees in a more extended position.The Romanian Deadlift is a movement that does something unique. It lengthens the hamstring under a load. During an RDL the tension is at its highest when your hamstring is at its most lengthened position (90° at the hips with extended knees). Therefore, the most important part of this exercise is feeling the stretch in your hamstring on each trip. You can also use this to dictate your range of motion. Some people will be able to go all the way to the floor while maintaining a flat back. While others will only be able to get to a 90° hip angle. A rare person with hypermobile hips may even need to consider a Deficit RDL. In which they stand on a platform, letting them go even lower than the barbell and plates would allow for. Again, look for the stretch on each rep and use that feeling to dictate when you initiate the concentric portion of the movement. When you feel the stretch, time to come back up.It's of the utmost importance you keep a flat back so you do not put any unnecessary stress on your lumbar spine. This does not mean you will not feel this exercise in your lower back. The opposite is true. You can and most likely will feel the RDL working your lumbar spine. This does not mean you are doing anything wrong. The lower back has muscles just like everywhere else in your body. These muscles can also fill with blood giving you a pump in your lower back. Unlike having a pump in your biceps or pecs, a pump in your lower back is very uncomfortable because the spinal erectors swell and begin to press into your lumbar spine. Again, this does not mean you were doing anything wrong. You can even expect some soreness in your lower back after performing this movementThe concentric portion of this movement is relatively simple. Just go to a standing position to complete the rep. Do not force your hips all the way forward as this will hyperextend your lumbar spine. Hyperextension is just as dangerous as hyperflexion. "

Barbell Hip Thrust,Lower Body,Push,Glutes,Barbell,"Barbell Hip thrust Detailed How To:SetupGrab a box, (or a bench) that is roughly 18 to 24 inches in height. Grab some type of pad to go between your hips and the barbell. Getting the bar into place can be challenging depending on what you have access to. If you've got access to a weighted barbell like in our demo video, either place the bar on your hips while seated on the box or bench and slide down until your shoulder blades are at the edge of the box. Or, slide into position, with the bar standing vertically next to you, then carefully tip the bar over you and onto your hips. If you have plates that roll on the bar, it becomes a lot easier. In that instance, just roll the bar into place over your hips. If you have the 12 sided plates (most gyms will have these), it's a lot more challenging. You'll have to get the bar as close to straight over your hips as you can and then scoot into position. Once you have the bar in place on your hip bones, take your stance. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart, and toes facing forward. You don't want your feet too far forward or back. If your feet are too far forward, it will shorten the range of motion. If your feet are too far back you will turn the hip thrust into more of a quadricep movement. Once you have your stance, grab the bar with either a double overhand or mixed grip. Your hands should only be keeping the bar in place as you perform the movement. Make sure your shoulder blades are pulled back and dug into the box. Now we initiate the hip thrust.Performing The Barbell Hip thrustForce your hips as high as you can. Hip Thrust variations do something no other glute movements do. The tension is at its highest at the top of the movement when the glutes are in their contracted or shortened position. Therefore, the most important part of the hip thrust is the very top end of the range of motion. You will know you're in the right spot when you feel your glutes contract really hard.There is no need to touch your butt or the plates all the way back to the floor on each rep. Just go as low as you can without touching the plates back down to the floor. This will keep tension on your glutes."

Barbell Deadlift,Lower Body,Pull,Lower Back,Barbell,"Ty's TipsMy Deadlift, Not YoursThe deadlift involves many muscles, all of your limbs, and every loadbearing joint (ankles, knees, hips and shoulders) in your body. There are a lot of variables at play. So having hardandfast rules about deadlift form is nearly impossible.Your body is your body. That seems like an obvious fact, yet it’s one that’s often overlooked when it comes to form.For example, two people who are the same height may have totally different torso and femur lengths.A person who has a short torso and long femurs will have a more hipdominant pull, meaning that their butt will be higher in the air and most of the force will come from their glutes and hamstrings. Meanwhile, a person who has a long torso and short femurs would be able to get lower and involve their quads a bit more.Detailed How To#1. Your stanceConventional Deadlift Foot Placement: You can start with your feet shoulderwidth apart. If you’re not sure where this is, try this: Jump in the air 23 times. Where your feet land naturally is the proper stance for the conventional deadlift. Your toes should point forward or outward slightly.Set up so that the bar is about an inch to an inchandahalf from your shins. When you look down at the bar, it should be positioned right about the middle of your foot, blocking the laces of your shoes from view.#2. Your gripFiguring out where to place your hands is quite simple. Just take a shoulderwidth grip.Choosing how to grip the bar is a little more complicated, and may change throughout your workout. There are three main options:Option #1: The doubleoverhand grip. This is the “best” grip most of the time. As you increase the amount of weight you can deadlift, you’ll eventually reach a weight where your grip strength becomes an issue. That’s when mixed grip comes in…Option #2: The mixed grip. Also known as “one overhand, one underhand” grip, this style allows you to pull heavier weights more easily. Option #3: The hook grip. This grip is not very popular and for good reason—it hurts, but it’s not without benefits. The idea behind the hook grip is that you can use more weight than a doubleoverhand grip, since your thumbs act as hooks for the bar. But here’s the thing: Much of the weight ends up pulling on your thumbs. The stress this places on the tissue, bones, and joints of your thumbs does not feel good. One way people attempt to eliminate the grip problem altogether is to use straps.Executing the DeadliftYou really only need to think about two things when you pull the bar:Push off the floorKeep everything tight (especially your core and lats)During a conventional deadlift, if you are thinking about “pushing the floor away,” it will help you generate tension throughout your hips and knees.Keeping your core, arms, and lats engaged will help you avoid rounding your spine, which is dangerous. DO NOT ROUND YOUR SPINE.When you reach the top of the rep, known as lockout, be carefulSome people seem to think that “locking out” means “leaning back,” but nothing could be further from the truth. Doing that hyperextends your knees and spine, which can compress those allimportant spinal discs between your vertebrae. DO NOT HYPEREXTEND YOUR SPINE.The goal, really, is to just stand up. "

Forearm Plank,Core,Hold,Abs,Bodyweight,"Forearm Plank Detailed How to:SetupI suggest starting in a kneeling position as opposed to starting with your hips on the ground. When you begin from the hips on the ground position, your lumbar spine is hyperextended, which is dangerous and to be avoided in the overwhelming majority of exercises.You can either do a closed fist or open hand position. Whichever feels more comfortable. Step one foot back, and then the other to begin the Plank.Performing The Forearm PlankBe careful to not let your hips rise or sag as you were holding the forearm Plank. Maintain a flat back the entire set. If you are having trouble knowing if your back is flat, try performing the exercise in front of a mirror so you can check your form. Continuously press your elbows into the ground and spread your scapula. This will recruit your serratus anterior and get you some extra core work.How To Progress The Forearm Plank:Like any other exercise, progression is important with the Plank. However, since the Plank is a hold and not a dynamic exercise with reps, it can be challenging knowing how to and when to progress the Plank. Here’s a quick step by step guide on progressing the PlankSet a range similar to a rep range. For example, 45 to 60 seconds. Let’s say in the beginning you are only able to do 45 seconds. Each week, try to add a bit more time (25 secs). Once you are able to complete 60 seconds with good form time to further progress.Switch to a more difficult variation. The natural next step is switching to the Hand Plank. Keep your same time range of 4560 seconds. Since this is a more difficult variation you will likely fatigue before 60 seconds. Build your way back to 60 seconds like you did with the Forearm Plank. Add weight. At this point, it’s time to try adding some resistance to the Plank. Start light! You can either ask a gym buddy or place the weight on your back yourself. Either way, make sure the plate is in the middle of your upper back and not your lumbar spine.

Hand Plank,Core,Hold,Abs,Bodyweight,"Hand Plank Detailed How to:SetupI suggest starting in a kneeling position as opposed to starting with your hips on the ground. When you begin from the hips on the ground position, your lumbar spine is hyperextended, which is dangerous and to be avoided in the overwhelming majority of exercises.You can either do a closed fist or open hand position. Whichever feels more comfortable. Step one foot back, and then the other to begin the Plank.Performing The Hand PlankBe careful to not let your hips rise or sag as you were holding the Hand Plank. Maintain a flat back the entire set. If you are having trouble knowing if your back is flat, try performing the exercise in front of a mirror so you can check your form. Continuously press your hands into the ground and spread your scapula. This will recruit your serratus anterior and get you some extra core work.How To Progress The Hand Plank:Like any other exercise, progression is important with the Plank. However, since the Plank is a hold and not a dynamic exercise with reps, it can be challenging knowing how to and when to progress the Plank. Here’s a quick step by step guide on progressing the PlankSet a range similar to a rep range. For example, 45 to 60 seconds. Let’s say in the beginning you are only able to do 45 seconds. Each week, try to add a bit more time (25 secs). Once you are able to complete 60 seconds with good form time to further progress.Switch to a more difficult variation. The natural next step is switching to the Hand Plank. Keep your same time range of 4560 seconds. Since this is a more difficult variation you will likely fatigue before 60 seconds. Build your way back to 60 seconds like you did with the Forearm Plank. Add weight. At this point, it’s time to try adding some resistance to the Plank. Start light! You can either ask a gym buddy or place the weight on your back yourself. Either way, make sure the plate is in the middle of your upper back and not your lumbar spine. Then you can progress the plank similarly to any other exercise. By adding weight bit by bit overtime.You can continue to progress by going to a more difficult hold (Long Lever Plank, Hollow Hold) and then adding weight to those over time. "

Comments
Throughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and back straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout movement. Keep bar close to body to improve mechanical leverage. Grip strength and strength endurance often limit ability to perform multiple reps at heavy resistances. Gym chalk, wrist straps, grip work, and mixed grip can be used to enhance grip. Mixed grip indicates one hand holding with overhand grip and other hand holding with underhand grip. Lever barbell jack can be used to lift barbell from floor for easier loading and unloading of weight plates.
Barbell Deficit Deadlift emphasizes building strength through lowest portion of Deadlift. Target muscle is exercised isometrically. Heavy barbell deadlifts significantly engages Latissmus Dorsi. See Barbell Deficit Deadlift under Gluteus Maximus. Also see Deadlift Analysis."

 comments 
 
 keep the hips low when lifting, the shoulders up, your arms and back straight.Throughout the movement, the knees should point in the same direction as the feet.Hold the bar close to the body to improve the mechanical leverage.The handle and strength endurance often restrict the ability to carry out several repetitions in the event of severe resistance.Gymnastics chalk, wrist tapes, grip work and mixed handle can be used to improve the handle.Mixed handle means that a hand with over -handed and the other hand with subtle grips is held.The dumbbell can be lifted from the floor with the lever dumbbell to facilitate the loading and unloading of dumbbell slices.

Knee elevations,Core,Hold,Abs,Pull-up bar,The elevation of legs at 90 ° in the bar is a very intense exercise in which all abdominal muscles intervene.
Frontal elevations,Upper Body,Push,Shoulders,Barbell,"To execute the exercise, the lifter stands with the feet separated to the width of the shoulders and weights or resistance mangoes are sustained to the sides with a grip in pronation (above the head).

The movement consists of carrying the arms in front of the body at the height of the eyes and with only a slight flexion of the elbow.This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (in front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.

When lifting it is important to keep the body motionless so that the anterior deltoid is completely used;If the weight cannot be lifted while still, then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed.It is important to maintain a slight flexion in the elbow when lifting, since keeping the elbow will add tension to the elbow joint and could cause injuries.

You can also use a neutral grip, similar to the one used in the hammer curl.With this variation, the weight rises again to the eye level, but at an angle of 45 degrees from the front of the body.This can be beneficial for people with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the sleeve of the rotators."

Front Raises,Upper Body,Push,Shoulders,Barbell,"To execute the exercise, the lifter stands with their feet shoulder width apart and weights or resistance handles held by their side with a pronated (overhand) grip.
The movement is to bring the arms up in front of the body to eye level and with only a slight bend in the elbow. This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.
When lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.
A neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff."

Muscle up,Upper Body,Pull,Back,Pull-up bar,"The body is then explosively pulled up by the arms in a radial pull-up, with greater speed than a regular pull-up. When the bar approaches the upper chest, the wrists are swiftly flexed to bring the forearms above the bar. The body is leaned forward, and the elbows are straightened by activating the triceps. The routine is considered complete when the bar is at the level of the waist and the arms are fully straight.
To dismount, the arms are bent at the elbow, and the body is lowered to the floor, and the exercise can be repeated.
As a relatively advanced exercise, muscle-ups are typically first learned with an assistive kip. The legs swing (kip) up and provide momentum to assist in the explosive upward force needed to ascend above the bar. More advanced athletes can perform a strict variation of the muscle-up which is done slowly, without any kip. This variation begins with a still dead hang and uses isometric muscle contraction to ascend above the bar in a slow, controlled fashion."

Push Up,Upper Body,Push,Chest,Bodyweight,"A push-up is a calisthenic exercise that involves lifting and lowering your body using your arms. They are commonly used to build upper body strength, improve core stability, and enhance overall physical fitness. Push-ups can be performed virtually anywhere and require no special equipment, making them a convenient exercise for home workouts or when you don’t have access to a gym."

The back is always straight and as well as the neck (always look to the ground). Lower yourself to the initial position and repeat."
Push-Ups,Upper Body,Push,Chest,Bodyweight,"Push-ups are an exercise in which a person, keeping a prone position, with the hands palms down under the shoulders, the balls of the feet on the ground, and the back straight, pushes the body up and lets it down by an alternate straightening and bending of the arms."
Push-Ups | Decline,Upper Body,Push,Chest,Incline bench,"Decline push-ups are another modified version of the traditional push-up that target the upper body muscles in a different way. To perform a decline push-up, elevate your feet on an elevated surface, such as a bench, chair, or step, while placing your hands on the ground in a push-up position. Lower your body towards the ground while maintaining a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles, and then push back up to the starting position.

Unlike the inclined push-up, the decline push-up places more emphasis on the shoulders and triceps, while still engaging the chest muscles to a lesser extent. By elevating your feet, you increase the difficulty of the exercise by placing more weight on your upper body, forcing your shoulders and triceps to work harder to push your body back up. The decline push-up can be a great way to challenge your upper body strength and improve your ability to perform other push-up variations. As with any exercise, be sure to use proper form and start with a height that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."
Push-Ups | Incline,Upper Body,Push,Chest,Incline bench,"Inclined push-ups primarily target the chest muscles (pectoralis major and minor), but also work the triceps, shoulders, and core to a lesser extent.
